# Handlebars Isomorphic

Example on how to render the same Handlebars template on both client-side and server-side (isomorphic rendering). Also includes client-side routing via Navigo. The advantage of this approach is that you can have smooth navigation on the client-side while still serving server-side rendered pages to search-engines and fast initial load.

Uses Vite for bundling and runs on Vercel
